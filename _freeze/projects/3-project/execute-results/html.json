We used drone data from The Guardian that detailed the type of attack and the number of casualties in Yemen from 2002 - present. We formed 3 hypothesis relating to presidential administrations, death vs strike count, and location. In this report, I display the graphs my group and I used and what we learned from them. \n---\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Libraries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(fuzzyjoin)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning\n\nRead in Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyemen <- read.csv(\"yemen.csv\")[1:324,]\nhead(yemen)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Strike.ID       Date   Location Province\n1    YEM001 03/11/2002    Unknown    Marib\n2    YEM002 17/12/2009  Al Majala    Abyan\n3    YEM003 17/12/2009      Arhab    Sanaa\n4    YEM004 24/12/2009       Rafd   Shabwa\n5    YEM005 12/01/2010    Unknown   Shabwa\n6    YEM006 15/01/2010 Al Ajashir    Saada\n                                    Type.of.attack\n1                                     Drone strike\n2                            Cruise missile strike\n3 US-Yemen ground operation\\nPossible drone strike\n4        Airstrike\\nPossible cruise missile strike\n5   Yemen ground operation\\nPossible US assistance\n6                                        Airstrike\n  Confirmed..possible.US.attack.

Dots on the dashed line indicate full certainty. The number of strikes nearer to 0 show discrepancies, but the dots farther from 0 show certainty. This could mean that higher strike counts are more reliably recorded compared to lower strike counts.\n\n## Data Anomalies\n\nWe corrected instances where minimum and maximum ranges were reversed.

Strikes peaked during Trump’s first term, while Obama’s first term saw the highest fatalities per strike. Notable spikes occurred in 2012 and 2017, likely tied to aggressive early-term military strategies and regional unrest. Regions like Abyan experienced the highest casualties, reflecting AQAP activity and counterterrorism focus.\n\nDespite increased strikes in 2012, civilian and child casualties were relatively low, suggesting efforts to minimize collateral damage. However, the analysis is limited by the dataset ending in mid-2019 and a lack of detailed variables like drone type or specific strike goals. Broader influences such as shifts in political power and international dynamics were not fully considered.\n\nThe findings highlight the need for more comprehensive research to understand the long-term impacts and driving factors behind U.S. drone operations in Yemen.\n",
